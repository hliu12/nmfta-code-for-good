# Tufts Code for Good NMFTA Bouncer Wrapper
This repository contains a python wrapper for the NMFTA Bouncer API, interacting with the API to incite dynamic responses to threats. The Python file blacklist.py contains all of the 

 ## Wrapper Description
This wrapper was created to diversify the bouncerâ€™s response to threats by inciting dynamic responses. The wrapper does this by randomly either blocking the geolocation or the IP address of an identified threat for a random time period between 8-24 hours.

## Usage
The functionality of the bouncer may be tested by running blacklist.py in the following manner:

```bash
python blacklist.py [IP Address] [flag]
```

Currently, there are 3 unique flags to choose from:
To run the IP address blocking feature, do:
```bash
python blacklist.py [IP Address] --ip
```
To run the geolocation blocking feature, do:
```bash
python blacklist.py [IP Address] --geo
```
To randomize the response chosen, do: 
```bash
python blacklist.py [IP Address] --random
```


## **Installing**

### **Prerequisites**
May require installation of python libraries such as:  
* Requests
* Datetime
* Sys
* Random
* Shodan  

Additionally, requires installation of Debian OS and Apache in order to test Bouncer actions on a server.

### **API Setup/Reference**
This wrapper was made for the NMFTA's open source bouncer API, which contains details on how to set up a
local instance of the bouncer API. Installation instructions and documentation can be found at the open 
source repo [here](https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-bouncer)

## **Testing**

Due to the issues we experienced with setting up a local environment of the bouncer API, test calls were 
done on a mock server of the API. The documentation for this mock server can be found [here](https://nmftabouncer.docs.apiary.io/#)
