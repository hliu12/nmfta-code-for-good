# Tufts Code for Good NMFTA Bouncer Wrapper
This repository contains a python wrapper for the NMFTA Bouncer API, interacting with the API to incite dynamic responses to threats. 

 ## Wrapper Description
This wrapper was created to diversify the bouncerâ€™s response to threats by inciting dynamic responses. The wrapper contains a variety of responses including ip and geolocation blocking with aspects of randomness and time checking implemented. See Usage for more detail about each response.


## Usage

### Blacklist.py
This script implements a dynamic response by randomly either blocking the geolocation or the IP address of an identified threat for a random time period between 8-24 hours.  
Currently, there are 3 unique flags to choose from: -ip, -geo, and -random. The script will activate the response indicated by the flag, or for the random flag, choose a response randomly.  
The functionality of the script may be tested by running:
```bash
python blacklist.py [IP Address] [flag]
```

### Timezone_geoblock.py
This script checks that a user at a given IP address is attempting to connect at a reasonable time of day (7AM - 10PM), and blocks the geolocation of the given IP address up until a reasonalbe hour if the time of day is suspicious.

The functionality of the script may be tested by running:
```bash
python timezone_geoblock.py [IP Address]
```

## **Installing**

### **Prerequisites**
May require installation of python libraries such as:  
* Requests
* Datetime
* Sys
* Random
* Shodan  

Additionally, requires installation of Debian OS and Apache in order to test Bouncer actions on a server.

### **API Setup/Reference**
This wrapper was made for the NMFTA's open source bouncer API, which contains details on how to set up a
local instance of the bouncer API. Installation instructions and documentation can be found at the open 
source repo [here](https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-bouncer)

## **Testing**

Due to the issues we experienced with setting up a local environment of the bouncer API, test calls were 
done on a mock server of the API. The documentation for this mock server can be found [here](https://nmftabouncer.docs.apiary.io/#)
